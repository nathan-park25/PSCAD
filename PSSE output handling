# By using psspy dyntools, PSSE output file can be saved ad dictionary type in Python
# dictionary has contraint to handle and extract values from full dictionary.
# to streamline process of plotting, data handling, this code can be applied

# getting output

 ## here that idex is as same as output channel number shown in output file. 
 
 # Even, dataframe makes easier handling data # for exameple, 
 f = (data[19]+1)*50
 # data[19] has freuquency but this value is deviation based on 0 as of pu. DataFrame support direct vector, array calculation. which can be converted real frequency number
